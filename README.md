Requirements: Textboxs, Labels, Combobox, Checkbox, Buttons and Grid
When the user opens the page for the first time, the grid should be empty. When the "New User" button is pressed, the elements for the user to enter their information should appear on the right side of the screen. When the user enters the information correctly and presses the "Save User" button, the user should be registered and pressed on the grid on the left side of the screen. If the user checks the "Hide Disabled User" Checkbox, the data in the grid should be deleted.
